I don't know, maybe one day I'll truly become a computer, and my dream will come true.

But behind these utopian dreams lies a simple person who just wants to know everything. Isn't it strange? Wanting to know everything. It could be called greed, but when did hunger for knowledge become a bad thing? Every second, every minute, millions of pieces of information are being stored on the internet. Fresh and up-to-date. People say not knowing too much brings happiness, and that’s true, but I don't think someone who has their brain connected to a computer would care about happiness. Can you imagine that moment? Limitless knowledge, instantly. Beyond enlightenment, as if you’re using 100% of your brain, right? I don't know, maybe I’m rambling, but these are my thoughts, and if we had abandoned silly dreams, technology wouldn’t have advanced this far.
