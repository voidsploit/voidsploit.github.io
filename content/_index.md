# The Utopian Future of Weak Bodies, Trapped in Flesh and Bone

Humans and computers are similar things.

I want to become a digital entity, free from biological limitations.

---

Fragile bodies, limited lives. But a merged mind and the internet? Infinite knowledge, infinite power.

**My only wish is for this not to remain just a dream.**

This is both an image and a blog where I share my thoughts from time to time. I created it to preserve my memories for the future.

Perhaps, when I merge my soul with a computer and my memories fade, I will find them here. Who knows?
